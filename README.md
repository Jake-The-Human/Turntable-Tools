# Turntable-Tools

The goal of this project is to make an device that measure RPM, Wow, Flutter, Rumble and help Level a turntable.

Right now I am using a AdaFruit Feather board and a mems device.

Main Menu Buttons:
A: Rpm Mode
B: Leveling Mode
C: Rumble Measurement not sure if this will be added

RPM Buttons:
A: Back to main menu
B: Start measuring RPM data
C: Set an offset to help if sensor is noisy

Leveling Button:
A: Back to main menu
B: None
C: Set an offset to help if sensor is noisy

Rumble Button:
None

More to come soon.
